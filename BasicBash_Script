Here's a simple bash script that demonstrates basic functionalities such as printing text, variables, conditional statements, and loops:

### Basic Bash Script

#!/bin/bash

# A basic bash script

# Define a variable
greeting="Hello, world!"

# Print the greeting
echo $greeting

# Ask for the user's name
echo "What is your name?"
read name

# Greet the user
echo "Nice to meet you, $name!"

# Check if the user provided a name
if [ -z "$name" ]; then
  echo "You didn't provide a name!"
else
  echo "Thanks for telling me your name, $name!"
fi

# Loop through numbers 1 to 5
echo "Let's count to 5:"
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo $i
done

# End of the script
echo "Script execution completed!"
```

### What this script does:
1. **Variable Declaration**: Assigns a string to the variable `greeting`.
2. **Output**: Uses `echo` to print text to the console.
3. **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter their name using `read`.
4. **Conditional Statement**: Checks if the input is empty and prints different messages accordingly.
5. **Loop**: A `for` loop counts from 1 to 5, printing each number.

To run this script:
1. Save it in a file, e.g., `basic_script.sh`.
2. Make it executable by running: `chmod +x basic_script.sh`.
3. Execute it with: `./basic_script.sh`.

Would you like to extend this script with additional features or logic?
